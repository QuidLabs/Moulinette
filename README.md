### sUSDe / sDAI / sFRAX

Earn extra (with the possibility  
of slashing some of your stake);  

the counterparty to this:   
token-holders wishing to  
insure against price drops.

While insured by the contract...ETH  
and wBTC tokens are also deployed  
as LP capital in the largest Uniswap  
V3 pool (fees are auto-compounded  

and get distributed to insurers);  
contract can't insure more than   
the total value of sUSDe staked  
as insurance capital (earning  
pro rata rewards & liabilities).  

The cost of insurance is votable  
by insurers...using a weighted  
median of their sUSDe stakes.  
The range is 1-9% (lumpsum).
