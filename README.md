## üëÅ‚Äçüó®U!D protocol...

After [maturing](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/z/zero-couponbond.asp), 1 QD can be   
redeemed for $1. There are  
43 days ([discount window]((https://bit.ly/3q4tShS)))  
to mint, "yesterday's price...  
is not today's price"; the ROI  
is, on average, 46%  as Diet  
Coke has 46mg of caffeine.  
To start, it's only 71% liquid,  
just like the Earth's surface.  

### re-staked sDAI, sUSDe

Same core principle as Eigen:  
earn extra (possibly slashing  
some stake due to taking on  
extra risk)...the counterparty  
to this are token-holders that  

wish to insure their ETH and /   
or WBTC against price drops.  
We are working on enabling   
an Eigen-based bridge to be  
insured while operators are  
in charge of a BTC multi-sig.

### "non-fungible" nature  

While insured by the contract  
tokens are also deployed as LP  
capital in the largest Uniswap  
V3 pool (auto-compounded,  
fees retained for backing QD).  

Coverage dilutes QD's realisable  
yield, [distributed](https://www.youtube.com/clip/UgkxOMAUJfrx-_ABwnargyEURpPygXEXJ_d9) as a function of  
one's ROI relative to the [average](https://github.com/QuidLabs/QD/blob/main/contracts/MOulinette.sol#L412).

The total $ value of tokens  
insured cannot exceed the $  
staked as insurance capital,  
and the total coverage that  
is [carryable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_of_carry) is also capped.  

### optional governance

A stake-weighted median of  
insurer votes forms what %  
is deductible (half will get  
charged upfront, half on  

withdrawal if an insured  
event is triggered). An  
insured event is a price  
drop of 2 x deductible %.
