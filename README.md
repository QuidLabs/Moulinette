## QD x MOulinette 

Insurers receive QuiD for  
commitments to re-stake  
USDe over a duration of   
1yr; there are 16 chances  
to `mint`: 8 per year times  
[43 days](https://bit.ly/3q4tShS), "yesterday's price  

is *not* today's," 46% avg  ROI.  
The receivables are collateral  
for future cash flow from ETH  
getting deployed into UniV3,  

fees retained to capitalise QD,  
as well as sUSDe boosted via  
Morpho, **gradated** liquidations  
from longs, and deductibles of

token-holders wishing to  
insure their ETH against  
price drops of over 10%,  
minting QD as insurance  
coverage (not upfront)...  
over time, QD bridges its   

30% gap in capitalisation to  
become fully backed; using  
discount windows allows   
protocol liquidity to grow  
linearly (guarded launch).  

Deductible is initially [357](http://www.niagaramasons.com/Info%20Stuff/The%20Winding%20Staircase.PDF)bp;   
APY is [distributed](https://www.youtube.com/clip/UgkxOMAUJfrx-_ABwnargyEURpPygXEXJ_d9)  relative to  
one's ROI versus avg. ROI,    
absorbing liabilties upon  
maturity, when any holder  
may `redeem` 1 QD for $1;  

voting is incentivised by a  
small QD lotto, distributed  
16x `onERC721Received`    
As a simplified metaphor,  
it's an investment **vehicle**:

- electric ignition system (nervous system):  
  make ETH `deposit` if nervous about price,  
  or to maximise your time value of USDe...
- `repackNFT`: the fuel management system,  
   most of the functionality is internal (send  
    wei gas to cylinders, to combine with air)
    - controlled by the electrical system, as are its sensors,  
  observing temp. (TWAP) and air density (tick range)

- `redeem` engine has a cooling system to absorb protocol debt
- breaks, clutch, CDP transmission  powered by hydraulic `withdraw` 
  - can't withdraw without steering (`vote`), and suspension is related:  
  determines your ride quality (`fold` as suspension === liquidation)
