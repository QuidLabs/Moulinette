## UNI<>Ethena Coverage 

While insured by the contract...ETH  
and wBTC tokens are also deployed  
as LP capital in the largest Uniswap  
V3 pool (fees auto-compounded).  

Contract can't insure more than   
the total value of sUSDe staked  
as insurance capital (earning  
pro rata rewards & liabilities).  

The cost of insurance is votable  
by insurers...using a weighted  
median of their sUSDe stakes.
