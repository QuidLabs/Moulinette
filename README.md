## in my ~~opinion~~ [offer](https://hackmd.io/@quid/mint)

Hedging can be achieved  
by selling futures; QD is  
a non-custodial future $.  
Insurers receive **Q**ui**D** for  
commitments to re-stake  

`USDe` over a duration of   
1yr; there are 16 chances  
to `mint`: 8 per year times  
[43 days](https://bit.ly/3q4tShS), "yesterday's price  

is *not* today's," 46% avg ROI  
(before accounting liabilities);  
the receivables are collateral  
for future cash flow from ΞTH  
getting deployed into UniV3,  

fees retained to capitalise QD...  
as well as sUSDe yield (Morpho  
boosted), **gradated** liquidations  
from longs, and deductibles of

token-holders wishing to  
insure their ΞTH against  
price drops of over 10%,  
minting QD as insurance  
coverage (not upfront)  
over time, QD bridges   

30% in `capitalisastion`  
becomes fully backed; with    
discount windows, insurable  
$ value in ΞTH and / or BTC  
grows in a gradated manner,    
and in a manner providing  
equal opportunity to stake.

Levering long while buying  
insurance (at the same time)  
protects against liquidations.  
Deductible is initially [357](http://www.niagaramasons.com/Info%20Stuff/The%20Winding%20Staircase.PDF)bp;   
APY is [distributed](https://www.youtube.com/clip/UgkxOMAUJfrx-_ABwnargyEURpPygXEXJ_d9) relative to  

one's ROI versus avg. ROI,    
absorbing liabilties upon  
maturity, when any holder  
may `redeem` 1 QD for $1.  

Voting is incentivised by a  
small QD lotto, distributed  
16x `onERC721Received`.  

There will be a vetting  
process for selecting   
a pool of eligible lotto  
recipients...must show  
proof of `work`...both  
ΞTH [informal](https://github.com/johnquid/RicardianTriplerDoubleTokenLeXscroW/tree/arbitration?tab=readme-ov-file#arbitration) & [formal](https://github.com/QuidLabs/IMO/blob/main/contracts/MOulinette.sol#L124).  

Power is the work done  
per unit of time. QuiD  
powers an investment  
**vehicle** for a `MO` mint:

- electric ignition system (nervous system):  
  `deposit` ΞTH if nervous about its price,  
  or USDe to maximise your time value of $
- `repackNFT`:  fuel management system;  
   most of the functionality is internal (send  
    wei gas to cylinders, combined with air)
    - controlled by the electrical system, as are its sensors,  
  observing temp. (TWAP) and air density (tick range)
- `redeem` engine has a cooling system for absorbing liabilities
- breaks, clutch, CDP transmission powered by hydraulic `withdraw` 
  - can't withdraw without steering (`vote`), and suspension is related:  
  determines your ride quality (`fold` as suspension === liquidation)

Speaking of cars, another decent  
analogy is [carbide](https://www.instagram.com/p/C_t_orDph5p/) lamps...**fiat** *lux*  
 (let there be light); regarding lime,  
note how [70/30](https://www.instagram.com/p/DAgKU2dxtUq/) here  corresponds  
to the initial capitalisation of QD...  
Earth's surface is also 70% liquid.
