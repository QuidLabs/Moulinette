QD is a LIT, lite ERC404...  
the `tokenURI` will arrive  
after [maturing](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/z/zero-couponbond.asp)...1 QD can  
be redeemed for $1. There's  
a "discount window" during  
which QD is mintable for [40  
days](https://bit.ly/3q4tShS) if we consider ~7 % to  
be the minimum for staking  
rewards, then QD will be  
76% backed at the end...  

### re-stake sUSDe / sDAI

Same basic principle as Eigen:  
earn extra (possibily slashing  
some stake due to encumbering  
extra risk). The counterparty  
to this: token-holders that  
wish to insure their ETH and  
/ or WBTC against price drops  
(coverage dilutes QD yield).  

The "non-fungible" nature  
of the `_balances` relates  
to their individual ROIs,  
which will determine how  
much liabilties they must  
absorb; those more able  
to absorb...will absorb  
more ("fair" taxation).  

While insured by the contract  
tokens are also deployed as LP  
capital in the largest Uniswap  
V3 pool (fees auto-compounded,  
and retained for backing QD).  

The total $ value of tokens  
insured cannot exceed the $  
staked as insurance capital,  
and the total coverage that  
be extended is also capped.  

LPs can vote for what the  
% deductible is (half gets  
charged upfront, half on  
withdrawal if an insured  
event is triggered). An  
insured event is a price  
drop of 2 x deductible %.
